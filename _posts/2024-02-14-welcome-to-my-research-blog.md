# Welcome to My Research Blog

I'm excited to launch this new space where I can share my thoughts, research updates, and insights from my journey in cognitive science and visual perception.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will serve as a platform to discuss:

- **Research Updates**: Progress on my current projects involving transcranial stimulation (tRNS, TMS, tACS) and visual perception phenomena like the Flash Drag Effect
- **Methodological Insights**: Reflections on experimental design, data analysis approaches, and the tools I use in my research
- **Cognitive Science Perspectives**: Thoughts on how the brain processes visual information and what this tells us about perception and cognition
- **AI and Neuroscience**: Exploring the fascinating parallels and differences between biological and artificial intelligence

## My Research Focus

Currently, I'm investigating how the brain integrates sensory information with prior expectations—a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. My work combines behavioral experiments with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to understand the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception.

The Flash Drag Effect, a phenomenon where a briefly flashed object appears displaced in the direction of nearby motion, serves as an excellent model for studying these processes. By modulating activity in visual areas V1 and MT using different stimulation protocols, we can test specific hypotheses about how the brain constructs our visual experience.

## Why This Blog?

Science thrives on communication and collaboration. Through this blog, I hope to:

1. **Share knowledge** beyond traditional academic publications
2. **Connect** with fellow researchers and students interested in similar questions
3. **Document** my research journey, including the challenges and breakthroughs
4. **Engage** with broader discussions about perception, cognition, and AI

## What's Next?

I'm currently working on several exciting projects that I'll be sharing here soon. Stay tuned for posts about:

- How stochastic resonance might enhance visual processing
- The role of oscillatory activity in perceptual decision-making
- Practical tips for running psychophysics experiments
- Reflections on the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you!
